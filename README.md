# Installation Guides Repository

## Introduction
This repository contains **installation guides** for various tools and technologies, providing structured steps and best practices for setting up software efficiently. Each tool has its own dedicated directory, ensuring easy navigation and separation of concerns.

## Repository Structure
All installation guides follow the same **organizational structure**, ensuring consistency across different technologies.

### Folder Organization
Each tool's installation guide is stored in a separate directory inside `install_guides/`, following this example structure:

```
install_guides/
├── conda_miniforge3/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── installation_steps.md
│   ├── common_commands.md
│   └── troubleshooting.md
├── nodejs/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── installation_guide.md
│   ├── package_management.md
│   └── best_practices.md
├── java/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── installation_steps.md
│   ├── environment_setup.md
│   ├── common_commands.md
│   └── advanced_topics.md
└── maven/
    ├── README.md
    ├── setup_guide.md
    ├── project_structure.md
    ├── dependency_management.md
    └── troubleshooting.md
```

## Core Guidelines & Best Practices

### 🛠 Directory Naming
- Each tool gets its own directory (`conda_miniforge3/`, `nodejs/`, `java/`, `maven/`).
- Use **lowercase and underscores** for directory names to maintain consistency.

### 📖 Documentation Structure
- Each directory contains a `README.md` providing an overview of that tool’s installation guide.
- Supplementary markdown files break down installation, commands, and troubleshooting.

### 🔄 Consistency in Installation Steps
- Installation steps should be **clear, structured, and minimal**.
- Ensure guides follow **step-by-step instructions** that users can replicate.

### 📦 Package Management Recommendations
- Provide guidance on **best practices for managing dependencies** (e.g., pip vs conda, npm vs yarn, Maven dependency resolution).
- Avoid unnecessary complexity—each guide should **focus on practical usage**.

### ❓ Troubleshooting Section
- Each installation guide should include **common issues and their fixes**.
- Ensure troubleshooting steps reference **error messages users might encounter**.
